#  Sales-analysis_SQL Project

#  Overview: 

This SQL project focuses on analyzing sales data from the Metabase database, which includes three main tables: Sales_fact, Category_dim, and Geography_dim. The goal is to use SQL queries and analysis to extract valuable insights and address important business questions in the retail and sales domain. By doing so, we aim to improve sales strategies and enhance profitability.

#  Problem Statement

The retail industry is undergoing rapid transformation, and staying competitive requires not only offering the right products but also understanding customer behavior, category performance, and geographical nuances. This project seeks to address key challenges and opportunities within the sales domain, leveraging the Metabase database, and addressing the following questions:

1) Highest Daily Sales: What is the highest sales amount in a single day, and on which date did it occur? Understanding peak sales days can aid in inventory management and marketing strategies.
2) Category Sales Analysis: What is the total sales of specific product categories, such as 'Dairy' and 'Cereals'? Identifying top-performing categories is crucial for inventory planning and marketing focus.
3) Geographical Insights: Which city has the highest sales? Geographical analysis can help optimize distribution and understand regional customer preferences.
4) Customer Spending Patterns: How many customers spent less than a specified amount (e.g., Rs. 3000)? This information can inform customer segmentation and loyalty programs.
5) Category Sales by City: What is the sales of a specific product category (e.g., 'Cereals') in a particular city (e.g., Bangalore)? Combining category and geographical data provides localized insights.
6) Top Category by Location: Which product category is the top seller in a specific location (e.g., Mumbai)? Understanding regional preferences can guide marketing efforts.
7) Highest Sales Value by Category: What is the highest sales value for a specific category (e.g., 'Drinks and Beverages') in a single transaction? Identifying high-value transactions can be vital for profit analysis.
8) Average Spending per Customer: What is the average amount spent per customer in a particular city (e.g., Chennai)? This metric helps gauge customer purchasing power.
9) Lowest Selling Product in a Category: What is the sales amount of the lowest-selling product within a category (e.g., 'Cereals')? Identifying underperforming products aids in inventory management.
10) Average Revenue per Customer by State: What is the average revenue per customer in a specific state (e.g., Maharashtra)? State-level analysis helps identify profitable regions.
11) Customer Spending in a State: How many customers in a specific state (e.g., Karnataka) spent less than a certain amount (e.g., Rs. 3000)? This metric assists in customer segmentation.
12) Cities with Low Average Revenue per Customer: How many cities have an average revenue per customer lower than a specified threshold (e.g., Rs. 3500)? Identifying underperforming cities can guide marketing strategies.
13) Most Popular Product: Which product was purchased by the most number of customers? This insight can guide inventory and marketing decisions.
14) Products with Multiple Customers in a State: How many products were bought by at least a certain number of customers (e.g., 5) in a specific state (e.g., Maharashtra)? Identifying products with broad appeal aids in inventory management.
Highest Average Spending per Product: What is the highest average amount spent per product by a customer? Understanding high-value products can inform pricing and marketing strategies.
